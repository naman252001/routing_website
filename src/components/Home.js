      Dear [Srisa mam and Vikash sir], <br/>

As we conclude this chapter, I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for your incredible dedication and inspiring guidance throughout this course. Your passion for teaching and genuine care for each of us has made a lasting impact. You've not only imparted knowledge but also encouraged us to think critically, dream big, and believe in ourselves.

Thank you for creating a positive and engaging learning environment. Your lessons have gone beyond textbooks, and the wisdom you've shared will stay with us as we move forward. We are truly fortunate to have had you as our teacher.

Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors.

With deepest appreciation,<br/>
